# SummerAssignment
Contains the summer (2018) assignment for AP Computer Science A.


AP Computer Science A is a college-level course designed to teach students to design and implement programs that solve problems relevant to society, media, art and engineering.  Students will learn to use programming tools (the Java programming language) to solve complex problems through hands-on experience and examples.

An overview of the AP Computer Science course can be found on the link below.

Your assignment this summer is to complete the first 16 exercises (0-15) from the Learn Java the Hard Way book ( https://learnjavathehardway.org/book/ ).  Exercise 0 will ensure that you have a computer at home that is ready and able to program and compile Java code. We will be completing this book during the first quarter of the 2018-19 academic year. Please confirm the completion of Exercise 0 by printing the assignment page in the repository and having both you and one of your parents (guardians) sign below.

All Summer Assignment will be turned in using GitHub. You have several session on using GitHub prior to the summer of 2018. We will use the GitHub classroom platform to track and store all assignment. It is important that we follow these procedures during the summer so that when the 2018-19 school year begins we are ALL fully versed in the use of GitHub. 

Summer assignments that are not completed and turned in on the first meeting day will count as a 0%. 

AP Computer Science A is a demanding class and success depends on ability, development of prerequisite skills, and a willingness to study. Advanced Placement classes require more study time than the typical high school class and this course runs on an accelerated schedule. The requirements for the AP test are covered prior to the exam that is administered in the first week of May. A list of those requirements can be found by visiting the College Boards website
